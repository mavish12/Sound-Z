Developed a feature-rich Earphone Shopping App using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Ensured an elegant and responsive design using Bootstrap, guaranteeing optimal user experience across diverse devices, dynamic product listings, and real-time "Add to Cart" functionality. Enabled users to manage their shopping cart, including item modification and removal. Implemented secure user authentication with dedicated sign-up and login pages, prioritizing user data protection. This project highlights my skills in front-end development and creating interactive web applications.
